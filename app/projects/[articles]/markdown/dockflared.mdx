## Running Foundry VTT on Docker with Cloudflare Tunnels

<h3 style={{color: "#059669"}}> unexpose your foundry install </h3>

Now before you start mashing **SKIP TO RECIPE** I hope you won't begrudge my small preamble to the setup, which is fairly simple depending on your computing situation.

Being a tremendous nerd I am, I love Dungeons and Dragons (_and other assorted TTRPGs_). When my group went totally remote, I searched long and hard for a good virtual table top. I naturally went with Foundry for the amount of customization and the self hosting option. I'm the kind of person who will let a subscription go for months after not needing it, and I just couldn't justify another monthly fee.

I also wanted to do this as cheap as possible because my friends (_and I_) are flakey. The ability to spin up/shut down the service at will is great.

This amount of setup and security is probably overkill for the vast majority of folks, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to do. I'm going to show you how to set up Foundry VTT in a docker container and expose it to the internet using Cloudflare Tunnels.

### What you'll need
- A computer with a Linux distro installed (can be wsl2)
- A domain name registered with Cloudflare
- Some time to mess around with configs, get it working, and then break it again

### Getting Cloudflare ready
The easiest way to get started is to register a domain name with Cloudflare. You can expect to spend around $10 for a year's worth of hosting. They provide a lot of services, except for email if that's a dealbreaker. Otherwise you'll have to set your nameservers to Cloudflare's which will take some time to propagate.

Now once you're up and running in the Cloudflare console, go to the **Zero Trust** tab. From there you'll select **Networks** and then **Tunnels**. Click **Create Tunnel** it should automatically select **Cloudflared** as the method. Give your tunnel a descriptive name (like _foundry_ or something) and then select **Save Tunnel**. It will ask you to install and run your connector. Click Docker and copy the command it gives you. Paste that into your text editor of choice. Ignore everything but the super long code after then **--token** flag. That's your token, you'll need it later. It's very important to keep this somewhere safe and not share it with anyone. If you lose it, you can always generate a new one.

You'll then be taken to the Public Hostnames page. Select your domain name from the dropdown. I strongly suggest using a subdomain for your tunnel. So if you want to use something like **foundry.example.com* just put foundry in the subdomain section.

Under the service section select **HTTPS**. <bold style={{color: "red"}}>Super Important!</bold> If you are using HTTPS the tunnel will need your hostname to match your website name. This will be covered later in the compose file, but just make sure you're being consistent in naming throughout this process. The **URL** section should be something like **https://foundry.example.com:30000** the colon and number specifies the port you'll be using. I just keep it to the default 30000 for Foundry.

### Linux setup
First create a folder in your home directory.

```bash
mkdir foundry
```

Then create the files we'll need for to use docker-compose.

```bash
touch compose.yaml
touch .env
```

Now we'll need to generate the .pem files for HTTPS. Go to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your domain name from the **Websites** section. Open **SSL/TLS** and then **Origin Server**. (side note I recommend setting your TLS encrption to Full (strict) because SECURITY.) 

Click **Create Certificate**. Remove the hostnames under the **Hostnames** section and add only your Foundry subdomain. Again, it should only have your website name, so something like **foundry.example.com**. Once you've done that, click create. You'll see two sections, the **Origin Certificate** and **Private Key**. Keep the page open or keep the values handy, you'll use them in a second.

Now go back to your terminal and run the following commands to create our .pem files.

```bash
touch /etc/ssl/certs/example_cert.pem
echo "" > /etc/ssl/certs/example_cert.pem

touch /etc/ssl/certs/example_key.pem
echo "" > /etc/ssl/certs/example_key.pem
```

### The Recipe
This setup uses the great [felddy/foundryvtt](https://github.com/felddy/foundryvtt-docker) docker image. You can use whatever flavor of container you like, this is just the one I use. My compose file below relies on an .env file that you'll need to create. It should look something like this:

```env
CONTAINER_PRESERVE_CONFIG=true
FOUNDRY_ADMIN_KEY=""
FOUNDRY_USERNAME=""
FOUNDRY_PASSWORD=""
TUNNEL_TOKEN=""
FOUNDRY_TELEMETRY=false
FOUNDRY_MINIFY_STATIC_FILES=true
FOUNDRY_SSL_CERT=/etc/ssl/certs/example_cert.pem
FOUNDRY_SSL_KEY=/etc/ssl/certs/example_key.pem
HOSTNAME=path.example.com
FOUNDRY_IP_DISCOVERY=false
USERNAME="your_username"
```
You'll need to plug in your own values for the variables. Take a look at the felddy/foundryvtt documentation if you want to modify this config. Some of these are required and some are just my own personal preference and helper variables for organzing the compose file below. 

This guide sets up HTTPS traffic through the Cloudflare tunnel. Now, the tunnel itself is encrypted so it's not necessarily a requirement to have HTTPS, but it's a good idea to have it. I'll go through how to add the pem files later on. Just know that you'll need to rename them.

### The Compose File

```yaml
---
version: "3.8"

services:
  foundry:
    container_name: ${HOSTNAME}
    hostname: ${HOSTNAME}
    image: felddy/foundryvtt:release
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /home/${USERNAME}/.config/FoundryVTT
        target: /data
    environment:
      - FOUNDRY_PASSWORD
      - FOUNDRY_USERNAME
      - FOUNDRY_ADMIN_KEY
      - CONTAINER_PRESERVE_CONFIG
    expose:
      - "30000/tcp"
    networks:
      - foundry
        
  tunnel:
    container_name: cloudflared
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: tunnel run
    environment:
      - TUNNEL_TOKEN
    networks:
      - foundry

networks:
    foundry:
```

### Make it happen
Modify the compose and .env files to your liking using your favorite text editor. (I use vim, but I'm not a monster.) Once you're done, run the following command to start the containers.

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```
